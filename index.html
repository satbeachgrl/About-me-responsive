  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I love to make people happy through things I create, specifically, food, cards, and gifts. I am looking to continue that creative passion by learning to create dynamic websites. I am currently a Speech-Langauge Pathologist in the public schools, having also worked in the private sector. I am a "go with the flow" kind of girl, who enjoys the ride that is life. I am a mom to 7, soon to be 8, year old twins (and a dog and cat), and a wife to an incredibly supportive husband.</section>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What's Important</h2>
  <p>Happiness is most important. Life is short, make the most of everyday! Laugh, love, cry, smile, and hug!</p>
  <h2>Dream Job</h2>
  <p>As I started in this endeavour, I often thought about what I might be doing in the future. Being so new to this, I don't know what my dream job would be in this field, but I have some thoughts. I do know that I am excited and driven for change. I want
  to use my skills to get back to my creative side, web style. If we're talking about dream job, then I can't leave out mentioning having more flexibility in my schedule, perhaps even working some from home.</p>
  <h2>My music</h2>
  <p> I love listening to music when I'm cooking, which usually includes jazz, Dave Bruebeck style, a little Norah Jones, and it's been while, but can't leave out Jack Johnson. It gets picked up a notch when my husband is hanging in the kitchen.</p>
  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I love all that is food...cooking, finding ingredients, finding great recipes, and eating.</p>
